# Kobe Bryant Shot Predictor

This project was inspired by one of Kaggle’s 2016 competitions. “Kobe Bryant Shot Selection: Which shots did Kobe sink?” was a public competition in which participants had to predict whether 5000 of Kobe’s shots went in or not. Participants were given a dataset containing the circumstances of every point attempt in Kobe’s career. Using this dataset and applying machine learning concepts, I successfully predict approximately 65% of Kobe’s shots. In addition, I use the dataset to extract relevant statistics about Kobe’s career and provide them to the public.
